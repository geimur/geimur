Feel free to copy my black-, block-, regex- and whitelists. 

* **Whitelist.txt**: basic list of domains which are to whitelisted, please add your own whitelist preferences to your local whitelist.
* **Blackist.txt**: the lists from which my blocklist is being created, I try to keep this list updated. 
* **Regex.list**: this is a small blocklist using [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Syntax).
* **Black.list**: some addresses which additionally could be blocked which weren't covered by the big blacklist.

I try to keep these lists updated but I can't garantee that some erroneous behvaiour shows up. This still seems rather unlikely, because I check the changes before I push them, but I am normally rather occupied so I will not check as thoroughly every time as I'd like to.
If you find any errors please tell me.

##### Note: this will break most social networking sites, but I created a simple Windows solution to temporarily disable DNS blocking for just that particular device found in the folder "clickable_change_DNS". For UNIX based systems, I assume you are capable of just manually updating the network configuration.
